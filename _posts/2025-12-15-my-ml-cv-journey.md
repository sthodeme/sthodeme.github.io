title: "My Machine Learning & Computer Vision Learning Journey"
---

I am transitioning into Machine Learning and Computer Vision with a focus on
practical understanding rather than just theory.

My goals:
- Build strong ML foundations
- Apply deep learning to vision problems
- Create real-world projects

This blog will document what I learn, mistakes I make, and insights I gain.
